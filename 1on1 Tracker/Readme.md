# Tiny 1:1 Tracker for Engineering Managers

## 🚀 Purpose

A lightweight, single-file 1:1 notes tracker for Engineering Managers who want to remove friction and maintain accountability without bloated tools.

## 🎯 Why?

As an EM, you need:

- A **quick, private place** to take notes during 1:1s.
- Easy **tracking of past agreements and follow-ups**.
- Zero overhead and no tool-switching.

Most days, Google Docs or Notion become heavy or fragmented. This tracker keeps everything **in one place**.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Create notes for each 1:1** with your reports.
- **Track action items** and mark them as completed.
- **View history** of each report in seconds.
- **Local persistence** (data is saved in your browser, private to your device).
- **Export / Import** your notes in JSON for backup or device migration.
- **Single-file HTML**: open and use in any browser, no server or install needed.
    
## ⚙️ Tech

- Pure HTML, CSS, JS (embedded, no dependencies).
- Uses `localStorage` for persistence.
- Lightweight, mobile-friendly.

## 📦 Usage

1. Download `tiny-1on1-tracker.html`.
2. Open in your browser.
3. Add your reports and start taking 1:1 notes.
4. Export your data periodically for backup.

## 🎁 Example Use Cases

- Track goals discussed during 1:1s.
- Record wins, challenges, and notes for each report.
- Review last agreements before your next 1:1 without searching in chats or scattered docs.

All your notes live **only in your browser**. No data is sent anywhere.
