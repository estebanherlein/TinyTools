Here is the **translated spec to English** as requested:

## üéØ Purpose

Allow Engineering Managers to **log, review, and follow up on 1:1 agreements simply, quickly, and persistently**, eliminating weekly friction and avoiding forgotten commitments for each report.

---

## üë• **Common pains for EMs in 1:1s (basis for requirements)**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Forgetting past agreements or commitments between meetings.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Difficulty tracking each report's personal goals.
3Ô∏è‚É£ No quick visibility of each person's history.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Using heavy tools or scattered notes (Google Docs, Notion, paper).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Lack of a **private, portable, simple** space for sensitive notes.
6Ô∏è‚É£ No triggers to review agreements before each 1:1.

---

## ‚úÖ **Functional Requirements**

* Select or enter the **report's name** (dropdown with autocomplete if desired).
* Meeting date (auto-set to ‚Äútoday‚Äù with the option to change).
* Free text fields for notes, with suggested structure:

  * Wins
  * Challenges

## üö´ **Out of scope for v1**

* Automatic notifications or reminders.
* Calendar integration.
* Multi-user or real-time collaboration.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Non-functional Requirements**

‚úÖ **Single-file `.html`:**
