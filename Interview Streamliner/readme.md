# Interview Streamliner

**A simple, single-page tool to make technical interviews faster, fairer, and easier to track.**

## 🚀 Why this exists

Interviewing in fast-paced teams often means scattered notes, unclear evaluations, and subjective decisions. This tool helps **standardize your interview process** with clean checklists, dropdowns, and auto-generated summaries so teams can align quickly and fairly.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Checkbox and dropdown evaluation for skills, communication, and culture fit  
✅ Auto-calculates a seniority estimation  
✅ Generates a copy-paste summary for ATS or Slack  
✅ Fully local, lightweight, open-source
