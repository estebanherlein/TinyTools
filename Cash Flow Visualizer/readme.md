# Cash Flow Visualizer

**A simple tool for founders to visualize runway, burn, and break-even points without spreadsheets.**

## 🚀 Why this exists

Early-stage founders often lack clear visibility into how their revenue, costs, and growth affect runway and sustainability. This tool helps you simulate different scenarios quickly and visually, enabling faster, clearer decisions.

## 🎯 Features

- Input starting cash, expected monthly revenue, and monthly costs
- Visualizes runway (months until zero cash) and break-even point
- “What if” sliders to simulate changes in cost and revenue
- Line chart showing cash over 12-24 months
- Fully local, open-source, lightweight
